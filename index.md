### CPSC 120

*Lab 7, part 2 was one of my favorite labs because it was a repetition of what we did in lab 4. I enjoyed this lab because we used functions to make our code more simple. In lab 4 we used a lot of reintroducing variables to accomplish a certain task, but using functions in Lab 7 made the process easier. 

Lab 2, part 1 was another one of my favorite labs because it laid the foundation for all the other labs in terms of formatting. I gained a better understanding on formatting and why it was so important to do certain things such as adding a semicolon at the end of each statement in order to finalize it. I also thought that it was a great way to expose students who have never done coding as well. 

Lab 10, part 3 was another one of my favorite labs because it was the first image we created. I found this lab the most intersting because of the GraphicsMagick tool. When I was first exposed to it I did not really understand what GraphicsMAgick was and how it worked, but it was one of the more rewarding labs.
